 *         <P>Letâ€™s say that you have 25 horses, and you want to pick the fastest 3 horses out of those 25. In each race,
 *         only 5 horses can run at the same time because there are only 5 tracks.
 *         What is the minimum number of races required to find the 3 fastest horses without using a stopwatch?
 *         </P>
